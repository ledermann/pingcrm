# PingCRM on Rails

A demo application built with Ruby on Rails and Vue.js 3 to illustrate how **[Inertia.js](https://inertiajs.com/)** works.

This is a port of the [original PingCRM written in Laravel/PHP](https://github.com/inertiajs/pingcrm) to Ruby on Rails. Now it's possible to dive into the beautiful world of **Inertia.js** without having to install PHP ;-)

There is a hosted installation of this demo available at https://pingcrm.ledermann.dev. Login with:
