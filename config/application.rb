    # To allow Inertia.js handle backend exceptions, we need to register an
    # exceptions_app to show the exceptions via the `Error` Vue component.
    # This app needs to be a middleware. To keep things simple we define an
    # anonymous controller with a `show` method. This allows us to use
    # `render inertia: ...`
    #
    # The exception app will be used if `consider_all_requests_local` is set to false,
    # which is by default in production only
    #
